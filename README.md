这是一门新语言 This is a new language

类似于 typescript ，这门语言主要用于描述逻辑，并生成特定的语言代码。不过与 ts 主要生成 js 不同，我们的目标语言包括 js,golang,c/c++ 以及对大多数新生开发者来说比较老的 pascal/delphi/lazarus 。

我不太理解为什么那些中文大公司的开源项目也是全英文（难道是因为你们的开发者都是老外吗 :) ），因此我还是将项目以中文发布，然后自带“机翻”，省得老外朋友们还要开启翻译器 -- 假如真的有老外看我们这个项目的话。

I don't quite understand why the open source projects of those Chinese companies are also all in English (is it because your developers are all foreigners?😂), so I still released the project in Chinese and brought it with a "machine translator" to save foreign friends from having to open a translator - if there are really foreigners watching our project.
